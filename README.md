# Unofficial Passiv App

This is a very primitive version of a third-party app that I am working on for [Passiv](https://getpassiv.com), a tool that makes passive index fund investing easier and more automated for Canadians.

They've exposed their APIs, so I will be adding the following features from their web application:

* Calculating rebalances
* Placing orders
* Listing positions/account totals
* Ability to change some account settings
* Ability to adjust targets

Maybe more, but I think that's a good start!

The app is being written in React Native.
